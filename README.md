# Healthcare-Data-Analysis

This project focuses on predicting disease outcomes by analyzing patient information, diagnosis details, and treatment results. We utilize data scraping techniques, feature extraction, and both machine learning and deep learning models to build accurate predictive systems for healthcare insights.

Key Highlights:

Data Scraping: Extracting relevant healthcare data using BeautifulSoup from online medical sources

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, feature extraction, and transformation

Machine Learning Models:

Classification and regression models to predict disease outcomes

Deep Learning Models:

Neural networks (ANN) for enhanced prediction accuracy

Model Evaluation: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and RMSE

Tech Stack:
Python • BeautifulSoup • Pandas • Scikit-learn • TensorFlow/Keras • Matplotlib • Seaborn
